// TODO:
// * !!! If GUI is visible don't sleep. But we still want to poll infrequently. So maybe check elapsed poll time.
// * Remember window width and height
// * Unicode correctness
// * Path length correctness
// * Stop repeating work getting the firefox URL, maybe use UIAutomation cache?

// Obey licenses (may need to include license and copyright info, can google)
// TODO: When finished leave asserts and make them write to a log file instead of calling debugbreak()
// TODO: Don't hardcode sizes, make it a multiple of font size maybe
// can use array textures maybe, GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY texture target. Textures must be same size



### Wait for input
// TODO: ImGui might need to render 3 frames after input (from github imgui), making wait on input more difficult

// Cost of rendering imgui is generally lower than the cost of building the ui elements - "Omar"
