* * * * * Things that need doing * * * * * 


  -- Minimum viable product --
* Read/write from savefile
* Make all child backgrounds white
* Larger icon limit, free all icons once a day, and allow them to be reloaded on demand, (no real limit because 32x32 icon is 4K, so 10,000 icons is only 40MB, and GPU can swap to main memory)
* Safer writing to database file, (maybe copy and delete old file)
* Popup on unrecoverable errors
* Add own licence and licences of used open source code (and maybe fonts)
* Get memory allocation sizes right

  -- Finished product --
* Low framerate UI (not that needed, and adds lots of complexity)
* Event driven (not polling) for window switches and tab switch
* Website icons (maybe using duckduck go or google service)
* Better keyword support, allowing different records for subdomains and different paths in a domain
* Idle detection
* Delay unloading all UI resources for 10 seconds when UI closed maybe?
* Day start/end time for allowed recording
* Autostart at system startup
* Make imgui_impl files better, remove unneeded stuff
* Array textures




// -----------------------------------------------------------------
// TODO:
// * !!! If GUI is visible don't sleep. But we still want to poll infrequently. So maybe check elapsed poll time.
// * Remember window width and height
// * Unicode correctness
// * Path length correctness
// * Stop repeating work getting the firefox URL, maybe use UIAutomation cache?
// -----------------------------------------------------------------

// Obey licenses (may need to include license and copyright info, can google)
// TODO: When finished leave asserts and make them write to a log file instead of calling debugbreak()
// TODO: Don't hardcode sizes, make it a multiple of font size maybe
// can use array textures maybe, GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY texture target. Textures must be same size
